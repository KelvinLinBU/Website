                Hi! My name is Kelvin Lin, and I am an undergraduate studying computer science and business administration and management right in the heart of Boston! 
                Passionate and driven are words that I would use to describe myself; there exists no challenge that is too big or too difficult.
                I have studied and used the programming languages, Python, Java, HTML/CSS, and I am currently studying UNIX and C in my university coursework.
                I am also skilled in the MS suite of products such as Microsoft Word, Microsoft Powerpoint, and Microsoft Excel as part of my pursuit of the study of Business Administration.
                I have also completed courses relating to probabilities in computing, geometrical/algebraic algorithms, and I can also demonstrate extensive financial/managerial accounting knowledge.
                With these skills that I have acquired, I hope to be an asset to your company!

                I grew up in snowy upstate New York as the child of immigrants. My parents immigrated here from China in search of the American Dream. They found it in our family restaurant that they started
                back in the 90s. Growing up, my brother and I always found ourselves behind the counter managing front end tasks, and the values of working hard for what you have were instilled into me at a young age. 
                In the words of the great Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson, "With drive and a bit of talent, you can move mountains." 
                My parents inspired me to pursue business and entrepreneurship. I picked up computer science when I took my first computer science class, and I instantly fell in love with it.
                Being able to make, create and solve spoke to me as an individual.
                During my time at Boston University, I've had the privilege to pursue my ambitions in a challenging but comforting environment.

                I'm also not someone who is all work, and no play! I've always believed in a healthy work-life balance.
                In my free time, I enjoy working on projects like this website! I enjoy challenging myself, and solving puzzles. I also enjoy going on snowy mountain hikes, and taking scenic photos.
                I'm also an avid foodie, and traveler. I'd like to visit all of the touristy places at least once in my lifetime. 
                I also love to play the violin and piano, having taken lessons for both for around 7 years. Through hard work, and dedication, I managed to secure a spot as the concertmaster for the Queensbury High School Chamber Orchestra and I've played in many prestigious ensembles such as All-County, and Area All-State groups.
                I also love the sport of sabre fencing, and I've fenced at multiple tournaments in the northeast! Anyways, that's all about me, and I sincerely hope to hear more about you!
